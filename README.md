# hub_turkr
A project for automatic content analysis using Mechanical Turk &amp; R

## Requirements

* Use `R` and the package `MTurkR`
* Enable the entire workflow from setting up an MTurk project, providing the data, as well as collecting & analyzing the results
* Start with setting up the mechanism for submitting MTurk jobs
* Should enable the manual content analysis of large volumes of Github comments according to a preset coding scheme

## Modus Operandi
A couple of notes on how we work:

* We will be working using a pull request model. This will allow me to review and understand the code you write as we go along.
* All scripts needs to run as-is on my machines (2 macs)
* The following style guide applies: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
* Remember that we are writing scripts, not doing interactive work, so commands which print things to the interactive shell should be avoided
* The project will be open source, so you can use it in your resume.
* Default is R, if necessary we go to Python.
* Code should be well-commented and use variable and function names which are intuitive and easy to understand
